# Project implementation summary

This project was implemented using the next tools or libraries:

- Nodejs, Typescript, Serverless Framework and DynamoDB.
- For compile and run this project you only will need to install Serverless globally since everything is based on it.
- The Spotify authentication is implemented using the [OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0)
- The server runs in [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000).


# Compiling and running the project

### Requirements

- Serverless Framework with following versions:
    ```bash
    $ sls --version
    # Output
    Framework Core: 2.64.1
    Plugin: 5.5.0
    SDK: 4.3.0
    Components: 3.17.1
    ```
    If you don't have it installed, you can see instructions [here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started).
- Docker Compose version `1.26.2` or similar. If you don't have it installed, you can see instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- (Optional) If you want to connect to Mongo database, you could install [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass).
    - Use the variable `DATABASE_CONNECTION_URI` available on `config/.env.dev`.
- (Optional) If you want to execute project on development mode, you need to install `NodeJs v12.8.3` and `NPM v6.9.0`

### Instructions

1. Create and Spotify application [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/), get your clientId and clientSecret tokens and setup these in `config/.env.production` and `config/.env.dev`.
1. Install Docker Engine and Docker Compose services, then start Docker Engine.
1. Open a terminal or console and navigate to project directory.
1. Create the docker network bridge used to allows communication between both containers server and database:

    ```bash
    docker network create -d bridge --subnet 172.0.1.0/24 --gateway 172.0.1.1 songs-net
    ```
1. Execute only database for initialite it:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up database
    ```
1. When log finish of moving, press `Ctrl + C` on your terminal to end database execution.
1. Execute database and server:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```
1. You should see a log on your terminal that looks like the following:
    ```bash
    Server running on http://0.0.0.0:8888
    ```
    - If you don't see this log, please try executing database and server by separated (two terminal), first the database and when it's ready then the server:
        ```bash
        docker-compose up database
        docker-compose up server
        ```


# Run load script

### **Resources**

- `docs/api.html`
- `docs/postman/Patagonian Backend Challenge.postman_collection.json`
- `docs/postman/Patagonian Backend Challenge.postman_environment.json`
- cURL commands

    ```bash
    # Populate
    curl --location --request GET 'http://127.0.0.1:8888/api/v1/songs/populate?ids=1r4hJ1h58CWwUQe3MxPuau,2gRP1Ezbtj3qrERnd0XasU'

    # Get songs with pagination
    curl --location --request GET 'http://127.0.0.1:8888/api/v1/songs?artistName=Maluma&limit=5&offset=10'

    # Get a song by songId
    curl --location --request GET 'http://127.0.0.1:8888/api/v1/songs/0GgGvBbhKzVKeiW8JdgyTh'
    ```

### **Instructions**

These are the instruction for run script that loads into a database all the songs from a list of Artist's IDs.

1. The script is executed using `/songs/populate` endpoint.
2. Build a list of Artist's IDs separated by comma and set in ids query param.
3. Execute the endpoint `/songs/populate`. Await for response that say you how much artists and albums are will be processed.
4. When the endpoint response, is possible that songs continue loading in background because can be a long process (depend on amount of artists) but you can check the log in the terminal.

# Adicional information (Optional)

### **Docker compose commands**

**IMPORTANT:**Â The next commands must be executed on root project directory.

- Execute database and server:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

- Execute only database:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up database
    ```

- Execute only server:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up server
    ```

- Execute containers forcing the build:

    ```bash
    # Both
    docker-compose up --build
    # Only server
    docker-compose up --build server
    # Only database
    docker-compose up --build database
    ```

### **Execute on development mode**

**IMPORTANT:** The next commands must be executed on root project directory.

1. Install NPM dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

1. Execute only database service using `docker-compose`:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up database
    ```

1. On another terminal execute server on development mode:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

1. (Optional) Execute test:

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```
